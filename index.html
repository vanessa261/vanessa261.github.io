<p>My name is Vanessa Alvarenga. I am a senior in high school! Class of 2018!!!! I am 18years old and im ready to get out and explore the world:) Some things that I enjoy doing is playing volleyball, cooking, reading and spending time with friends and family. I have 2 dogs, Cooper and Sheily they are twins and I love them with all my heart (Even when they make a huge mess.) High school has changed me in so many diffrent ways.<p>
